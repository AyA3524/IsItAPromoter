DNA Promoter Classification using CNN, BiLSTM, and Attention Mechanism 

This project focuses on classifying DNA sequences as promoters or non-promoters using a deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and an Attention mechanism. The model leverages nucleotide distribution features, including One-Hot Encoding and frequency-based representations, to enhance classification accuracy.

Key features:

CNN for feature extraction from DNA sequences

BiLSTM to capture long-range dependencies in the sequence

Attention mechanism to focus on crucial sequence patterns

Data augmentation to improve model generalization

Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and loss analysis


This repository contains the dataset preprocessing pipeline, model architecture, training scripts, and evaluation results.
